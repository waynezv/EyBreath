    "# Speaker Identification with Ey and Breath\n",
    "> Summary\n",
    "This project explores the possibilities and the methodologies to identify speakers' identities from short recordings of *`Ey` sounds* and *`breath`es*. We construct two neural networks to capture the features of sampled recordings and to predict the speaker identities. One is `conv_net + lstm`, and the other is `conv_net + tdnn`.\n",
    "===\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "Our goals are\n",
    "1. extract features from recordings;\n",
    "2. find ways to predict speaker's identity using these features, and prove their effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backgrounds\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "Looking at the `spectrogram` of the recordings, we observe that\n",
    "\n",
    "[comment]: # ([pic_spectrogram]: ./drafts/images/spectrogram.jpg \"Spectrogram\")\n",
    "1. different speakers have different harmonics and patterns;\n",
    "2. a speaker having a higher pitch would have similar patterns with a different person in `log-spectrogram`;\n",
    "3. the spectrograms of a same person with the same sounds have varied lengths (time durations).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to account for the scale invariance and the shift invariance, we propose\n",
    "1. use `constant Q transform` to extract spectrograms from recordings;\n",
    "2. use `convolution network` to extract features along the frequencies;\n",
    "3. use `recurrent network` (Long Short-Term Memory in this task) / `Time Delay Neural Network` (TDNN) to capture the dynamics along the time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constant Q transform\n",
    "It is closely relate to the Fourier transfrom. It has series of logarithmically spaced filters, making it suitable for analysing music signals. The key components of constant Q transform are\n",
    "1. The center frequencies are $f_k = 2^{\\frac{k}{b}}f_0$, where $b$ is the number of filters per oactave, $k = 1, \\ldots, K$, and the total number of frequency bins $K = b\\log_2(\\frac{f_{max}}{f_0})$.\n",
    "2. The bandwidth of the $k$-th filter is $\\delta f_k = f_{k+1} - f_{k} = f_k (2^{\\frac{1}{b}} - 1)$. The ratio of frequency to bandwidth is constant $Q = \\frac{f_k}{\\delta f_k} = \\frac{1}{(2^{\\frac{1}{b}} - 1)}$, and hence the notation `constant Q`.\n",
    "3. The window length for the $k$-th frequency bin is $N_k = Q\\frac{f_s}{f_k}$, where $f_s$ is the sampling frequency.\n",
    "4. Finally, the constant Q transform\n",
    "$$ x[k] = \\frac{1}{N_k}\\sum_{n=0}^{N_k-1}{x[n]w_{N_k}[n]}e^{-j2\\pi Qn/N_k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long Short-Term Memory\n",
    "The LSTM is a variant of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). It itself has many variants too. It was originally proposed by `Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber` in 1997, and then is used to effectively model contextual sequences. It is designed with internal memory cells and controlling gates to selectively memorize states and fight vanishing or exploding gradients. See the structure of a LSTM cell,![lstm_cell](./drafts/images/lstm_cell.png) and a sequence of cell units ![lstm_seq](./drafts/images/lstm_seq.png)\n",

    "The forward pass\n",
    "at time $t$\n",
    "1. Forget gate: $f_t = \\sigma(W_f x_t + U_f h_{t-1} + b_f) = \\sigma(\\hat{f}^t)$\n",
    "2. Input gate: $i_t = \\sigma(W_i x_t + U_i h_{t-1} + b_i) = \\sigma(\\hat{i}^t)$\n",
    "and candidate input: $a_t = tanh(W_c x_t + U_c h_{t-1} + b_c) = tanh(\\hat{a}^t)$\n",
    "3. Cell state update: $C_t = f_t C_{t-1} + i_t a_t$\n",
    "4. Output gate: $o_t = \\sigma(W_o x_t + U_o h_{t-1} + b_o) = \\sigma(\\hat{o}^t)$\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Backpropagation through time\n",
    "The error is backpropagated and the gradients are calculated to update the weights. Different with multilayer perception networks, we need to backpropagate the gradients through time (BPTT). ![bptt](./drafts/images/bptt.png) Using the chain rule, we unroll the network at each time step and compute the partial derivatives of the error wrt each paramter participated in. \n",
